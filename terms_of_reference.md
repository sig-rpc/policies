# Terms of Reference - Reasonable Performance Computing Special Interest Group

<!-- 
The document below should be edited to fit your special interest group (SIG). Some example text has been provided but can be deleted or edited as required.
-->

Last updated: (*2025-11-24*) - for more details see the update log below.

## Introduction

A Terms of reference document defines the purpose and structures of a project, committee, meeting, negotiation, or any similar collection of people who have agreed to work together to accomplish a shared goal. Terms of reference show how the object in question will be **defined, developed, and verified**.

This document details the terms of reference for the organisation and delivery of the special interest group *Reasonable Performance Computing (SIG-RPC)*.

*SIG-RPC is a community dedicated to the research, development and advocacy for performance best practices for those that work closely with software. We hope to ensure that all code achieves a minimum standard of reasonable performance, whereby all “easy performance wins” have been exhausted. Members of SIG-RPC shall collaborate to develop and disseminate guidance and training, for those that write software with any level of experience, related to techniques to profile and optimise code.*

As a charity, the Society must fulfil its legal obligations in many areas including but not limited to: equality, diversity and inclusivity, financial regulation, working with volunteers, protecting reputation, liability insurance, cancellation insurance, GDPR. 

Many of these legal obligations feature in the organisation of this working group and the Society Trustees must take responsibility for certain decisions and actions while at the same time formally delegating the organisation and delivery to the SIG committee. Final responsibility in all matters lies with the Society.

Where the term “the Society” is used, this refers to the Board of Trustees (as the elected representatives of the organisation) unless specified otherwise.

## Term

This Terms of Reference is effective from (*2024-11-08*) and continues until such time as the SIG is deemed to no longer be required.

## Committee Aim

<!-- What is the aim of the SIG committee? Does this help the Society’s charitable objectives? -->

*To organise collaboration in the community to foster the research, development and dissemination of knowledge relating to performance best practices for research software to raise awareness of how easy it can be to ensure reasonable performance. By welcoming members from all research backgrounds and industry to organise a varied programme of events.*

## Purpose and Aim of the SIG’s outputs

<!-- What event or outputs will the SIG generate? What is the purpose and aim of those outputs, and is it the society or SIG committee that’s responsible for setting that purpose? Please consider what the Society wants to achieve, as well as what the community wants and needs. -->

*SIG-RPC’s purposes are to:*

- *organise events for members interested in growing the collective knowledge around performance best practices for research software. These may take the form of facilitated discussions, workshops or other events which allow members to collaborate, to research and share performance best practice rules and develop related training materials.*
- *help members to deliver training around software performance by connecting them with other performance best practice instructors and students.*
- *advocate for wider application of performance best practices to the wider research software community through public outreach such as blog posts, videos or seminars.*
- *work with providers of research computing software and infrastructure, such as HPC, to bridge the gap with novice users.*
- *where applicable, aim to provide training materials that are broadly applicable, with the aim of allowing people from industries/fields beyond research software to also benefit.*

This purpose has been decided in collaboration between the SIG steering group and Society and under careful consideration of the RSE community and the external environment at this time. This purpose is not expected to change, and if significant changes are required they should be proposed to a Society trustee meeting for consideration and approval. 

## Budget

<!-- What is the approximate budget and requirements for the SIG? How will this be generated? What is the approximate amount that will be requested through the Society’s Events and Initiatives policy? -->

*The initial budget for the SIG during its founding phase is £0. Until SIG has an initial membership, and has identified what the community requires, all activities and publicity shall be hosted remotely and self-resourced.*

*Once the steering group decides the SIG is ready to progress beyond this stage it will update these terms of reference to include an approximate annual budget referencing any external funding sources, with the remaining budget to be requested through the Society’s Events and Initiatives Policy*

*Any requests to the Society’s Events and Initiatives Policy will be requested in a timely manner, at least 1 month before it is required so that it can be approved at the monthly trustee meeting. If funding is required quicker than anticipated, the Society will make this available as part of their support for the SIG.*

## Insurance Policies

<!-- What insurance policies, if any, are required for this SIG? -->

The Society Treasurer will ensure that any events are covered with appropriate insurance policies like but not limited to: Public Liability insurance, Events cancellation insurance. This should be organised in conjunction with the SIG committee so that all involved have full knowledge of what is both required and purchased.

## Reporting

<!-- How will the SIG committee report on progress to the Society, and how frequently? -->

*All SIG documentation will be stored within [the SIG’s GitHub organisation](https://github.com/sig-rpc), in markdown. Non-sensitive minutes and ToR will be available in public repositories for transparency. The Society can be given access to a private repository containing complete minutes at request. The Society will also be able to request compiled copies of minutes at their convenience.*

The Society requests that one of the SIG committee reports on progress to the Society trustee meetings every three months. This can be the same person each time or change as necessary depending on availability. The report can be made in person, or emailed to any one of the trustees for inclusion in the agenda. If required, the Society can create a folder on the Google drive for the SIG’s documents.

## Committee Roles

<!-- How will the SIG committee be structured? Which roles, if any, will be taken by members of the Society? How will volunteers be supported and guided? Will there be a steering group within the committee, if so which roles will be part of it? When will roles be appointed, and what is the process? Include a diagram/image of the committee structure if needed. -->

The SIG committee will consist of a majority of volunteers without any requirement that they be members of the Society. The SIG steering group will comprise a smaller section of the committee and most will be Society members. The Steering Group should ensure that working as a committee member is a fun and learning experience. To that end, we look for a proactive attitude from the Steering Group to ensure that tasks are evenly spread, giving opportunities to all volunteers to learn new skills and gain confidence. 

Four volunteers will form the Steering Group:

- *Chair*
- *Deputy-Chair*
- *Secretary*
- *Editor*

This steering group takes responsibility collectively for all decisions and can vote when unable to agree unanimously. If this vote doesn’t lead to agreement, the chair has the casting vote.

For induction, the Steering Group is asked to:

- Read this document carefully, discussing it with the Trustees for clarification if necessary

The process for appointing the SIG committee is as follows:

1. The founding steering committee was formed by volunteers from the 8 attendees at the initial meeting which agreed these terms of reference.
2. Once established the SIG will manage it’s own appointments, launching a call for volunteers when required. 

The open call is looking to fill these roles typically: (*chair, deputy-chair, secretary, finance*)

## Onboarding of Committee members

The Society asks that the Steering Group ensure that an initial onboarding meeting takes place to cover the following (but not limited to) activities:

- Introductions and icebreaker
- Circulate this document and ask all to read it carefully
- Ask each member to take the free (mandatory) online EDI training on https://elearning.acas.org.uk/
    - Bullying and harassment
    - Discipline and grievance
    - Equality, diversity and inclusion
- Read the [Organisation Code of Conduct](https://society-rse.org/about/policies/code-of-conduct/)
- Read the [Complaints and Grievances policy](https://society-rse.org/about/policies/)
- Read (at least) the following sections of NCVO’s guidance on ‘[Involving Volunteers](https://www.ncvo.org.uk/help-and-guidance/involving-volunteers/)’
    - Understanding volunteering
    - Recruiting and welcoming volunteers
    - Supporting and managing volunteers
    - Valuing and developing volunteers
    
## Removal of unproductive committee members 

In the unlikely event of an important committee role not being fulfilled with the possibility of that inaction jeopardising the SIG, the Steering group reserves the right to ask that volunteer to step down and will appoint a new person in that role. The new person will be appointed by the Steering Group. If any committee member is concerned about the behaviour or inaction of a fellow committee member, they can raise a grievance through our [Complaints and Grievances Policy](https://society-rse.org/about/policies/). 

The Society reserves the right to remove any member of the Steering group if sufficient progress is not being made and this inaction is thought to lead to a failure to deliver the SIGs goals.

## Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity

<!-- How will you work towards making the SIGs goals fit within our EDI policy and make any events open and accessible to all? -->

The SIG committee will read and follow the Society’s EDI policy, and ensure that there are goals in regards to equality, diversity, inclusivity and accessibility. These statements will be agreed on by the Society and the Steering Group as a reflection of the Society’s aspirations and goals for each of these areas for the RSE community.

The Society has an EDI team that are able to liaise and advise the SIG committee as needed, they can be contacted at edia@society-rse.org.

## The Environment and Sustainability

<!-- If relevant, how will you make the SIG environmentally friendly and sustainable? Will there be any giveaways at events? -->

*During the founding stage of SIG-RPC, all events will be held remotely with no potential for giveaways. The terms of reference will be changed in the future when this status is updated.*

*The goal of the SIG involves reducing the computing energy footprint, hence benefits sustainability.*

The Society asks that the committee think carefully about what giveaways it would like to make available to event attendees and make reasonable adjustments to minimise waste and the production of single use giveaways. 
This may take the form of 

- using an online programme app instead of printed copies, 
- compostable name badges, 
- reusing previous years lanyards
- encouraging attendees to bring reusable hot drink cups
- only have one main event designed giveaway (t-shirt)

The Society asks that any giveaways be reusable and useful and that this same behaviour is communicated to the sponsors.

## Feedback

<!-- Will the SIG collect any feedback from events? If so, how will this be collected and will it be shared with the Society? -->

*Event feedback will be collected via a Google form shared with attendees after the event alongside any collected minutes or other outputs of the event. This will allow attendees to review any event information, such as a blog, that is to be published to the Society website.*

The Society asks the Steering Group to create a feedback form for any event attendees, encourage participation after the event and compile a summary and blog post for the Society website. 

## Publicity and online presence

<!-- What publicity will the working group require? Would you like the Society to help set up accounts, a page on our website or to share materials? -->

*The SIG-RPC steering group will publish SIG information to a dedicated page within the Society’s website, that outlines the SIG’s mission and links to their website, mailing list and other resources.*

*SIG-RPC will use a Google groups mailing list (sig-rpc@society-rse.org), provided by the Society and managed by the steering group, to ensure all official communications from the Steering group are received by all members. The steering committee will also use a Google groups mailing list (sig-rpc-steering-group@society-rse.org) so that they can be contacted privately.*

*SIG-RPC will use the #sig-rpc channel within the Society’s slack to allow members, and visitors to discuss topics relating to the steering group’s above stated purpose.*

*SIG-RPC will use the GitHub organisation https://github.com/sig-rpc for managing all SIG activities, with the steering group instated as owners of the organisation.*

*SIG-RPC will provide a website/landing page (https://sig-rpc.github.io/), that includes links to the groups terms of reference, other documentation and information/links relevant to the SIG’s purpose and aims.*

The Society will help in the creation of an *X (formerly Twitter)* account and website and will actively help in the publicising of the SIG and any events from their own *X (formerly Twitter)* account. Any publicity should refrain from making any political or religious statements, from liking political, religious or extreme views online (or indeed anywhere) and understands that it does not represent the Society or the Society's views. 

## Codes of Conduct (CoC)

The Society has two Codes of Conduct currently in place: an [event CoC](https://society-rse.org/about/policies/code-of-conduct/) and an [organisation CoC ](https://society-rse.org/about/policies/code-of-conduct-for-trustees/)(also known as the Trustee Code of Conduct). The event CoC covers the expected conduct at events and on any online forums and apps. The organisation CoC covers the expected conduct for the committees and subgroups. The Society expects both of these CoCs to be adopted by the Steering Group. Any changes to either document would need to be requested to the Society and approved by trustee vote.
